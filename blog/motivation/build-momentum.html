    <h1>How to Build Momentum When You’re Stuck</h1>

    <p>Let’s be real — feeling stuck hits harder than a Monday morning with low Wi-Fi. Sometimes your brain just… stalls. You know what you *should* be doing, but the motivation tank is straight-up empty. The secret? Momentum isn’t magic. It’s a system — and you can reboot it way faster than you think.</p>

    <h2>Why You Get Stuck in the First Place</h2>
    <p>Being stuck usually means your brain is overwhelmed, exhausted, or straight-up bored. It’s not a personality flaw — it’s your mental CPU overheating. When the task feels too big, too unclear, or too pointless, your mind taps out and sends you scrolling on autopilot.</p>

    <p>So instead of trying to “get motivated,” you gotta trick your brain into motion. Once you’re moving, even a little, your mind goes, “Oh bet, we’re doing this?” and the energy ramps up.</p>

    <h2>1. Shrink the Task Until It’s Laughably Easy</h2>
    <p>Your brain hates big tasks. But it loves tiny ones. So break your job down until it seems almost stupidly small — like “open the doc,” “write one sentence,” or “clean one corner of the desk.”</p>

    <p><strong>Momentum hack:</strong> If it takes less than 60 seconds, do it right now.</p>

    <h2>2. Use the 5-Minute Rule (Your Brain Loves It)</h2>
    <p>Tell yourself you’ll only work for five minutes. That’s it. No pressure, no commitment. Your brain accepts because it sounds painless. And once you’re in motion, you almost always keep going.</p>

    <p>This rule works because it bypasses the mental friction that normally stops you from starting.</p>

    <h2>3. Change Your Environment (Instant Reset)</h2>
    <p>If you’re stuck, move. Literally. Sit somewhere else. Stand up. Change lighting. Switch apps. Put on headphones. Your brain links environments to behaviors, so a tiny shift can reset your vibe instantly.</p>

    <p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> A clean space = a clean mental slate.</p>

    <h2>4. Build a Quick “Win Stack”</h2>
    <p>Wins generate dopamine, and dopamine generates momentum. So stack a few quick victories early in your day — respond to one message, organize one file, knock out a tiny chore.</p>

    <p>Those little wins tell your brain: “We’re capable again.”</p>

    <h2>5. Stop Planning — Start Doing</h2>
    <p>Yeah, planning feels productive, but it also traps you. When you’re stuck, don’t create the perfect plan. Just take the next obvious step. The plan will form *while* you move.</p>

    <h2>6. Use “Future You” as Motivation</h2>
    <p>You don’t need to feel motivated. You just need to not sabotage the version of you that exists tomorrow. Imagine how relieved Future You will be when you’ve already done the annoying thing today.</p>

    <p>If you wouldn’t trash a friend’s progress, don’t trash your own.</p>

    <h2>7. Make It Fun or Make It Social</h2>
    <p>We’re not robots — vibes matter. Add music, turn it into a challenge, get a friend to hop on a call and do “focus time” together, or reward yourself once you finish.</p>

    <p>Even boring tasks hit different when they feel like a game.</p>

    <h2>8. Accept That Slow Progress Still Counts</h2>
    <p>Momentum doesn’t mean sprinting. Some days you’re flying; other days you’re crawling. Both count. What matters is direction, not speed.</p>

    <p><strong>The move:</strong> Don’t break the chain. Even a tiny action today keeps the momentum alive.</p>

    <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
    <p>Momentum isn’t about waiting for inspiration to smack you in the face — it’s about engineering tiny wins that snowball into action. Once you stop focusing on “being motivated” and start focusing on “making movement,” you unlock a whole different version of yourself.</p>

    <p>You’re not stuck — you’re just paused. Hit play again.</p>
