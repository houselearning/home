    <h1>How Geometry Shapes Modern Design and Architecture</h1>
    <p>
      Geometry isn’t just a math class flashback — it’s basically the secret blueprint behind everything clean, aesthetic, and structurally sound in today’s world. From skyscrapers that slice the skyline to the phone in your hand, geometry is running the whole show. Modern architects and designers use it to create stability, vibe, visual flow, and even emotional impact.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Geometry Is the Real MVP of Architecture</h2>
    <p>
      Every building you see — from a chill suburban house to the most extra futuristic tower — is built on geometric principles. Angles, planes, curves, symmetry, and ratios literally decide whether something stands tall or collapses like Jenga. But geometry doesn’t just keep things up; it keeps things beautiful.
    </p>

    <div class="highlight">
      Geometry gives architects two superpowers:<br><br>
      <strong>1. Control over structure</strong> — how weight is balanced, where forces go, and what shapes can support massive loads.<br>
      <strong>2. Control over aesthetics</strong> — how shapes interact with light, space, and human perception.
    </div>

    <h2>Symmetry & Balance: Why Humans Love Things That “Look Right”</h2>
    <p>
      Designers lean hard on symmetry because our brains eat it up. Perfect halves, mirrored sides, and centered layouts give us instant clarity and calm. That’s why modern buildings often use grids, even spacing, and mirrored patterns.
    </p>

    <p>
      But today's architecture often breaks symmetry *on purpose* to create contrast or drama. It’s like when your wallpaper is clean and minimal, but your lock screen is chaotic — it just works.
    </p>

    <h2>Triangles: The Strongest Shape in the Game</h2>
    <p>
      Triangles don’t mess around. They’re the reason bridges don’t fall and skyscrapers don’t wobble. When pressure hits a triangle, the force distributes evenly to all three sides — peak stability.
    </p>
    <p>
      Modern design uses triangles everywhere:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Roof trusses</li>
      <li>Support frameworks</li>
      <li>Geodesic domes</li>
      <li>Bridge supports</li>
      <li>Decorative patterns in modern interior design</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="highlight">
      If you’ve ever seen a building that looks like a sci-fi spaceship, triangles are probably doing 90% of the heavy lifting.
    </div>

    <h2>Curves: The Geometry of Flow and Movement</h2>
    <p>
      Curves soften a design and make it feel alive. They’re used when architects want something that feels futuristic, airy, or organic. Think museums, stadiums, sculptures, glass walkways — all rocking smooth arcs and spirals.
    </p>

    <p>
      Curved geometry also helps:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Reduce wind resistance</li>
      <li>Increase natural light reflection</li>
      <li>Guide movement through space</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Golden Ratio: Nature’s Favorite Equation</h2>
    <p>
      Ah yes — iconic. Designers still use the golden ratio because the human brain is wired to love it. It appears naturally in plants, shells, waves, galaxies… and now in laptops, posters, architecture, and phone UI layouts.  
      When architecture feels satisfying, it's probably secretly using this ratio behind the scenes.
    </p>

    <div class="highlight">
      The golden ratio = the difference between “kinda nice” and “wow this building hits different.”
    </div>

    <h2>Minimalism: Geometry’s Glow-Up Era</h2>
    <p>
      Modern design culture worships clean lines, sharp edges, and simple shapes. That’s literally geometry being the star of the show. Minimalist buildings use:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Rectangles for clarity</li>
      <li>Squares for stability</li>
      <li>Circles for contrast</li>
      <li>Repeating geometric grids</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Geometry helps architects crush that “clean, modern, open” aesthetic without overcomplicating things.
    </p>

    <h2>How Geometry Decides Light, Shadow, and Mood</h2>
    <p>
      Light interacts with geometry in wild ways. Sharp angles cast dramatic shadows. Curves create soft gradients. Slanted surfaces bounce sunlight into darker rooms.  
    </p>
    <p>
      Geometry decides how a space *feels* before you even know why — that's why architects obsess over angles the way coders obsess over indentation.
    </p>

    <h2>The Future: Algorithmic Geometry & Generative Design</h2>
    <p>
      New buildings are being designed by algorithms that generate thousands of geometric possibilities and pick the strongest, most efficient, or most aesthetic one. This is where geometry becomes high-tech.
    </p>
    <p>
      Generative design uses:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Fractals</li>
      <li>Parametric curves</li>
      <li>3D geometric modeling</li>
      <li>AI-optimized structures</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Imagine buildings shaped like coral reefs, shells, or spiraling DNA — geometry is unlocking that future.
    </p>

    <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
    <p>
      Geometry isn’t just part of design — it *is* design. Without it, modern architecture would be chaos. With it, we get buildings that are not only stronger and smarter, but straight-up gorgeous. Every shape, angle, arc, and ratio plays a role in making the spaces we live in feel intentional and inspiring.
